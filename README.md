# .kiro-bmad-template
my own personal starting point with BMAD standards from the BMAD project

Created using https://github.com/bonarjs/kiro-bmad-setup

BMAD: https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/src/modules/bmm/docs/README.md

Having set up BMAD in global context for all projects I can just copy and paste this into a fresh Kiro project folder and start here without  kiro-bmad-setup templates as I don't really want to use those just yet.

the .md files in this folder are for explaining to my future self how to use this stuff with a key new agent being added for Kiro Conversion of BMAD into Kiro specs.

This agent will be one I play with over time.
